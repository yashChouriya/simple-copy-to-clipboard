## Overview

Have you ever needed a simple way to allow users to copy text to their clipboard with just a click? This repository provides a minimalistic solution to that common problem. The included `index.html` file contains a JavaScript function that creates a temporary textarea element, sets its value to the desired text, and then triggers the copy action. This approach ensures a user-friendly experience for copying text.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:** 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-copy-to-clipboard.git
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in Your Browser:** 
   - Locate the `index.html` file in the cloned repository.
   - Open it in your web browser.

3. **Copy Text to Clipboard:**
   - Enter the text you want to copy into the provided input field.
   - Click the "Copy" button.
   - The text will be copied to your clipboard and pasted wherever needed.

## Code Explanation

The heart of this functionality lies in the JavaScript code snippet included in `index.html`. Here's a brief explanation:

```javascript
// JavaScript code snippet for copying text to the clipboard
function copy(string) {
  // Code details here...
}
```

The `copy()` function performs the following steps:
- Creates a temporary textarea element with the desired text.
- Sets the element as read-only and content-editable.
- Positions it off-screen to prevent page disruption.
- Copies the text to the clipboard.
- Finally, it removes the temporary textarea element.
